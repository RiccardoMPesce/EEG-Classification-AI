# EEG Classification AI
EEG Classification project for the class Cognitive Computing &amp; Artificial Intelligence at University of Catania (Academic Year 2021-2022)

## Brief Summary 
This method aims to learn the brain manifold that is obtained by training a Classifier using EEG. After verifying that visual information can be extracted from EEG data, a multimodal approach is carried out using deep image and EEG encoders for learning a joint manifold that maximizes a compatibility measure between visual features and brain representations.
